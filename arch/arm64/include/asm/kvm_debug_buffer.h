This is a circular buffer and it's wanted to  print the
logs in the same order as they were generated, there are two cases:
The Happy case:
	The write index didn't take a lap:
		Read from: -> read_index -> End
				-> Start -> write_index
		As long as you've got slots to read from
The Bad case:
	The write index  took at least one lap:
		Read from -> write_index + 1 -> End
			-> Start -> write_index
In both cases it is required to read from Right to End
and from Start to Left.
